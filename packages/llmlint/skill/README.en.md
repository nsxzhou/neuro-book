## What is llmlint

**llmlint** is a text linter for LLM-generated Chinese prose. It catches template-like wording, AI writing tells, hollow summaries, monotonous rhythm, and other rule-driven style problems — then helps you fix them without flattening the author's voice.

It has two faces that work together:

| Layer | Role |
| --- | --- |
| **CLI** (this repo's `bin/llmlint.ts`) | Stable, reproducible static checks via regex, density, and handlers, producing locatable candidates or statistical signatures. |
| **Agent Skill** (`SKILL.md`) | An LLM/agent reads the candidates **in context**, scores the text, drafts a fix plan, and rewrites *only after you approve*. |

The guiding principle: **a hit is a candidate, not a verdict.** The CLI never auto-rewrites your prose. Mechanical, judgment-free cleanups (invisible characters, ellipsis/em-dash tails) are the only thing `fix` touches; everything semantic stays with the human/agent.

## Why

LLM output has recognizable "tells" in Chinese: filler openers (其实、值得注意的是), mechanical transitions (首先…其次…最后), binary contrast scaffolding (不是…而是…), business jargon (赋能、抓手、闭环), inflated significance (深刻的影响、前所未有), sycophantic assistant-speak (好问题、希望这对你有帮助), and so on. Most are *stably locatable* by regex, but *deciding whether to cut them* needs context — a line of dialogue, a technical doc, or a deliberate rhetorical device may legitimately keep them.

llmlint splits those two jobs: deterministic location (CLI) and contextual judgment (agent).

## Requirements

- **Bun** (runs TypeScript directly, no build step) or **Node.js + [`tsx`](https://github.com/privatenumber/tsx)** (`npx tsx bin/llmlint.ts …`). The CLI source uses extensionless TS relative imports, which Node's built-in type stripping doesn't resolve — run it through `tsx` (or build first); Bun supports it natively.
- Dependencies: `commander`, `picocolors`, `tinyglobby` (all tiny, pure-JS, no native build)

## Install

**Recommended (as an Agent Skill)** — use the open [`skills`](https://skills.sh) CLI to install it into any supported agent (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, …) with one command:

```bash
npx skills add notnotype/llmlint --skill llmlint --full-depth
```

It copies / links the skill files into the agent's skills directory and drives the CLI per `SKILL.md`.

**Standalone CLI** — clone and install dependencies with Bun; the CLI runtime still supports Bun or Node + `tsx`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/notnotype/llmlint.git
cd llmlint/skill
bun install --frozen-lockfile
```

Run it directly (Bun runs TS natively; for Node see [Requirements](#requirements)):

```bash
bun bin/llmlint.ts check <file>     # Node: npx tsx bin/llmlint.ts check <file>
```

Or expose the `llmlint` command on your PATH (declared in `package.json` `bin`): run `bun link`, then `llmlint check <file>`.

> `SKILL.md` and `references/` use a `<skill-root>` placeholder. The agent prefers the absolute `root` supplied by its skill catalog; if the host only exposes the absolute `SKILL.md` location, it uses that file's parent directory. In standalone use, the current directory is the skill root, so run `bun bin/llmlint.ts …` directly.

## Quick start

```bash
# Before writing: emit writing constraints (markdown) to load into a system prompt or style preset
bun bin/llmlint.ts guide
bun bin/llmlint.ts guide --tier full            # include every word swap and deletion entry

# Scan static candidates in a file (or directory — recurses .md/.markdown/.txt)
bun bin/llmlint.ts check manuscript/chapter-01.md
bun bin/llmlint.ts check manuscript/

# Long file? Show only medium-and-up first
bun bin/llmlint.ts check chapter.md --min-level medium

# Small file / human reading? Show full lines with <mark> around hits
bun bin/llmlint.ts check chapter.md --show-lines

# Inspect the rule library; semantic rules expand to full criteria and examples
bun bin/llmlint.ts rules
bun bin/llmlint.ts rules --detector semantic

# Deterministic mechanical fix (zero-width chars, ellipsis/em-dash tails) — dry-run by default
bun bin/llmlint.ts fix manuscript/             # preview only (exit code 1 if anything pending)
bun bin/llmlint.ts fix manuscript/ --write     # write back to source files

# JSON output for tooling
bun bin/llmlint.ts check chapter.md --format json
```

For Markdown, `check` and `fix` skip code blocks / frontmatter / inline code / links by default so code and URLs aren't flagged as prose. Use `--scan-all` to scan everything.

## The three independent dimensions

Every rule carries three orthogonal axes — don't conflate them:

- **`level`** — `high` / `medium` / `low`. Severity only. Drives `--min-level` filtering and the exit code.
- **`review`** — `agent` / `human` / `none`. *Audience*: who should look at a hit. `check` defaults to `--review agent`, so author-preference noise (dashes, similes, generic adverbs) is parked in the `human` bucket and mechanical hits in `none`. Use `--review human` / `--review all` to see the rest.
- **`fixability`** — `auto` / `candidate` / `manual`. Mechanical fix capability. `fix` only applies `auto` rules.

The default ruleset has only two context-free mechanical `auto` rules, no default `candidate` rules, and treats everything else as `manual`. A user config may still promote explicitly chosen regex `replace` rules to `candidate` for one-by-one confirmation. An `action.replace` value is only a replacement template; **it does not grant permission to apply the edit**. The final authority always comes from the materialized `fixability` value.

`review` (audience) is **not** the same as `detector` (kind of criterion):

- **`detector`** decides what kind of criterion the rule uses: `regex` (lexical), `density` (statistical) and `handler` (algorithmic) are matched statically by `check`; `semantic` has no stable locatable signature and goes to the agent via `rules --detector semantic`.
- **`review`** decides *who a static hit is shown to* by default. It governs **review time only** — `human` means "confidence too low, don't let the agent rewrite it automatically", not "don't mention this rule while writing". Write-time selection is `guide --tier`.

A complete review runs both `check` (static hits for the agent) and `rules --detector semantic` (semantic rules).

Each rule also has an author-defined `scope.layer`: `narrative` scans only prose outside paired delimiters, `quoted` scans only same-line text inside paired `「」`, `『』`, `“”`, `‘’`, or `【】` (including the delimiters), and `all` scans both layers. Omitting scope resolves to `all`; project config cannot override it. ASCII straight quotes, unclosed delimiters, and cross-line pairs do not enter `quoted`.

Web browser scans and server-side MachineScan currently execute only regex+handler spans. Density remains visible in the rule registry but does not enter Web `hitsJson` or `docScore`. CLI `check` and Agent `lint_check` provide the complete regex+density+handler static scan.

## Configuration

Most projects need **no config** — without `llmlint.config.ts`, llmlint loads `builtin/default` and a tuned namespace policy. When you do want to customize, drop a `llmlint.config.ts` anywhere up the directory tree (auto-discovered from the cwd):

```typescript
export default {
    rulesets: ["builtin/default"],
    namespaces: {
        "vocabulary.r18": "off",          // turn off adult-vocabulary rules for general projects
        "商务黑话": "off",                  // Chinese alias → jargon.business
        "jargon.engineer": {review: "agent"}, // move a bucket into the agent view
    },
    rules: {
        "filler-word-actually": "warn",
        "firstly-secondly": "error",
        "filler-lets": "off",
    },
    output: "stylish",
};
```

- **Override priority:** rule id > namespace > ruleset > rule default.
- **String shorthand** is sugar for an object patch: `off` = `{enabled:false}`, `warn` = `{enabled:true, level:"medium"}`, `error` = `{enabled:true, level:"high"}`, and `low`/`medium`/`high` set the level. Object form `{enabled?, level?, review?, fixability?}` only overrides the fields you set — to enable a default-off rule you must write `enabled: true` explicitly.
- **Namespaces** accept stable English keys and built-in Chinese aliases (e.g. `商务黑话` → `jargon.business`).

See [`llmlint.config.example.ts`](./llmlint.config.example.ts) for a fully annotated example.

## Built-in ruleset: `builtin/default`

The official recommended ruleset — 360 rule records (266 enabled by default) across 71 namespaces, merged from a hand-maintained anti-AI-slop set and curated Chinese rule samples (`shuorenhua` / `avoid-ai-writing` / `humanizer`). Run `llmlint rules --format json` for live counts under your current config.

- **agent bucket (shown by default):** `filler`, `opening.cliche`, `inflation.significance`, `transition.summary`, `attribution.vague`, `cliche.uplift`, `sycophantic`, `jargon.business`, …
- **human bucket (high false-positive / author preference):** `punctuation.dash`, `metaphor`, `modifier`, `jargon.engineer`, `jargon.social`, `translationese`, `structure.fragment`, …
- **none bucket (mechanical):** `mechanical.zero-width` and the ellipsis/em-dash-tail subset of `punctuation.dedup`. Repeated exclamation/question marks are human-review only.
- **`mechanical.*` (language-agnostic, high precision):** zero-width characters, homoglyphs, leftover `{{placeholders}}`, chatbot copy-paste artifacts (`:contentReference`, `oaicite`, …).

It ships with R18 / adult-vocabulary rules; general projects can disable them with `namespaces: {"vocabulary.r18": "off"}` rather than editing rule files.

## Exit codes

- `0` — no problems, or only `low`/`medium` problems are visible.
- `1` — a visible `high` problem, a CLI failure, or (for `fix` dry-run) pending mechanical fixes.

Exit codes follow the **visible view**: hits hidden by `--review` / `--min-level` don't count. Use `--review all --min-level low` to make every high hit count (e.g. a CI gate like "no zero-width characters in the repo").

## Using as an Agent Skill

This repo is also a self-contained **Agent Skill**. `SKILL.md` defines a first-use dependency gate followed by a five-step local loop: `status` initialization → `check + detect` → combined report → approved delete/compress/rewrite repair plus one retest → ledger and local learning suggestions.

Recommended install via the [`skills`](https://skills.sh) CLI — `npx skills add notnotype/llmlint --skill llmlint --full-depth` — which searches the repository recursively, installs the `llmlint` skill from `skill/`, and drops it into the agent's skills directory (e.g. `.claude/skills/llmlint/` or NeuroBook's `.nbook/agent/skills/llmlint/`). For manual installation, copy the repository's `skill/` directory and name it `llmlint/` in the target skills directory. On first activation, the agent must run `bun install --cwd "<skill-root>" --frozen-lockfile` in the catalog-provided skill root before entering the `status` initialization gate. Later reviews reuse it while the dependency fields and `bun.lock` contract remain valid and `node_modules` exists; version, prompt, rule, or source-only updates do not reinstall. `package.json.version` is the skill version source of truth; it is not duplicated in `SKILL.md` frontmatter.

## Data sharing and privacy

`contribute` and `detect` are separate data paths. `contribute` only writes tier-filtered records to the local `~/.llmlint/outbox/`; this version has no login, network send, or upload path. The `fragments` and `full` tiers keep only safe snapshot names from the round directory, never original absolute paths; `stats` keeps neither filenames nor free text. Only a complete output snapshot set may produce `outputHash` or enter full text; incomplete output degrades to fragments with a machine-readable `degradedReason`. Inspect entries with `contribute --list`, and withdraw them by deleting an entry or the outbox directory.

`detect` does send uncached text chunks to the configured external detector, which defaults to an HF Space. Requests contain text chunks but no filename or project path. llmlint cannot control the remote service's logging or retention policy, and `sharing.off` only disables local contribution records; it does not disable `detect`. Do not run `detect` when text must stay on the local machine.
